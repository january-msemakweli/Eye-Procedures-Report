## 2. Frequency Distribution of Conditions

### 2.1 General Frequency Distribution

**Note:** Condition counts are based on the operated eye for each patient. Since the Singida dataset has a single "Conditions" column (not separated by eye), conditions are assigned to the eye that was operated on. Some individuals had more than one diagnosis (e.g., "Cataracts, Pterygium"), and each condition is counted separately.

### 4.2 Frequency Distribution of Conditions by Age Groups

**Methodology:** Patients were categorized into four age groups based on their age at the time of the eye camp: 19-40 years (young adults), 41-60 years (middle-aged), 61-80 years (older adults), and 81+ years (elderly). Conditions were assigned to the operated eye for each patient, since the dataset has a single "Conditions" column. This allows for comparison of condition prevalence across different age demographics. The analysis includes all condition occurrences, meaning if a patient had multiple conditions (e.g., "Cataracts, Pterygium"), each condition was counted separately.
